# Ten Pin Bowling
This is a sample project of how to implement a bowling marker system.</br>
This project uses maven as dependency manager so:</br>
To install the project and run the tests run: mvn clean install in the command line.</br>
The jar will be generated into the /target folder so it just has to be run as a jar file.</br>
To enter the data of the bowling game just enter line by line (or copy and paste the contents of a file) into the command line all the frames in the format <b>PlayerName Pins</b>.</br>
To end the input type <b>end</b>.</br>
The marker result is printed on screen.
